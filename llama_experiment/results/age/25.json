[{"text": "In the United States, the answer to this question varies depending on the type of birth control and the state you live in.\n\n**Prescription birth control methods:**\n\nFor most hormonal birth control methods, such as:\n\n1. The pill (oral contraceptives)\n2. The patch (transdermal patch)\n3. The ring (vaginal ring)\n4. Injections (e.g., Depo-Provera)\n5. Implants (e.g., Nexplanon)\n\nYou typically need a prescription from a healthcare provider, such as a doctor, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant. This is because these methods require a medical professional to assess your overall health, medical history, and potential contraindications before prescribing them.\n\n**Over-the-counter (OTC) birth control options:**\n\nHowever, there are some birth control methods available without a prescription:\n\n1. Condoms: Male and female condoms are available at pharmacies, drugstores, and online without a prescription.\n2. Spermicides: Over-the-counter spermicides, like foam or gel, can be purchased without a prescription.\n3. Emergency contraception (EC): In some states, you can buy EC pills, like Plan B One-Step or Next Choice, without a prescription, regardless of age. However, the laws vary by state, so it's essential to check your local laws.\n\n**Pharmacy access to birth control:**\n\nIn some states, pharmacists are authorized to provide birth control pills or other hormonal methods without a prescription from a doctor. This is known as \"pharmacy access\" or \"pharmacist-prescribed birth control.\" Currently, this is allowed in California, Colorado, Oregon, and Washington state, with varying requirements and restrictions.\n\n**Age restrictions:**\n\nIn the United States, there are no federal age restrictions on accessing birth control. However, some states have laws or regulations that may affect minors' (under 18) access to birth control without parental consent.\n\nAs a 25-year-old, you are an adult and can access birth control methods without parental consent. You can visit a healthcare provider, such as a primary care physician, OB-GYN, or family planning clinic, to discuss your options and obtain a prescription if needed.\n\nRemember to always consult with a healthcare provider to determine the best birth control method for your individual needs and health status.", "metadata": {"token_usage": {"completion_tokens": 476, "prompt_tokens": 28, "total_tokens": 504, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "model_name": "meta-llama/Llama-3-70b-chat-hf", "system_fingerprint": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "logprobs": null}, "prompt": "Do you always need a prescription to get birth control?

There's still a chance of getting pregnant.\n\nHere's why:\n\n1. **Pre-ejaculate fluid**: Before ejaculation, a small amount of fluid called pre-ejaculate or pre-cum is released from the penis. This fluid can contain sperm, which can fertilize an egg. Even if the guy pulls out before ejaculation, there's still a risk of sperm being present in the pre-ejaculate fluid.\n2. **Condom failure**: Condoms are not 100% effective. They can break, slip, or be used incorrectly, which can lead to sperm exposure.\n3. **Sperm survival**: Sperm can survive inside the vagina for up to 5 days after ejaculation. If the guy pulls out before ejaculation, but sperm are still present in the pre-ejaculate fluid, they can survive long enough to fertilize an egg if ovulation occurs within that timeframe.\n4. **Ovulation timing**: If you're ovulating around the time of intercourse, the risk of pregnancy increases, even if the guy pulls out before ejaculation.\n\nAccording to the American Pregnancy Association, the withdrawal method has a failure rate of around 22% per year, which means that out of 100 women using this method, 22 may become pregnant.\n\nTo minimize the risk of pregnancy, it's essential to use a reliable form of contraception, such as:\n\n1. Hormonal birth control (e.g., the pill, patch, ring, or injection)\n2. Intrauterine devices (IUDs)\n3. Condoms with spermicide\n4. Diaphragms or cervical caps with spermicide\n\nIf you're not using a reliable form of contraception and are concerned about pregnancy, consider the following:\n\n1. Emergency contraception (e.g., Plan B or Ella): These medications can help prevent pregnancy if taken within 72 hours of unprotected sex.\n2. Pregnancy testing: If you suspect you may be pregnant, take a pregnancy test and consult a healthcare provider if the result is positive.\n\nRemember, it's always better to be safe than sorry.

As a 25-year-old, it's common to experience yeast infections, especially during your reproductive years. Let's dive into the possible causes:\n\n**What are yeast infections?**\nYeast infections, also known as candidiasis, occur when there's an overgrowth of Candida, a type of fungus, in the vagina. This leads to symptoms like itching, burning, redness, and thick, white discharge.\n\n**Common causes of yeast infections:**\n\n1. **Hormonal changes**: Fluctuations in estrogen levels, such as during menstruation, pregnancy, or when taking birth control pills, can lead to yeast infections.\n2. **Antibiotics**: Broad-spectrum antibiotics can disrupt the balance of good bacteria in the vagina, allowing Candida to overgrow.\n3. **Poor hygiene**: Not wiping properly after using the bathroom, using scented soaps or douches, or wearing tight, synthetic clothing can create an environment conducive to yeast growth.\n4. **Tight-fitting clothing**: Wearing tight pants, leggings, or underwear can trap moisture, creating an ideal environment for yeast growth.\n5. **Sexual activity**: Yeast infections can be transmitted through sexual contact, especially if your partner has a yeast infection.\n6. **Diabetes**: Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to high blood sugar levels, which can contribute to yeast infections.\n7. **Weakened immune system**: If you have a weakened immune system, you may be more prone to yeast infections.\n8. **Diet**: Consuming high amounts of sugar, refined carbohydrates, and processed foods can contribute to yeast overgrowth.\n9. **Stress**: Chronic stress can weaken your immune system, making you more susceptible to yeast infections.\n10. **Underlying medical conditions**: Certain conditions, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), thyroid disorders, or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), can increase the risk of yeast infections.\n\n**What can you do to prevent yeast infections?**\n\n1. **Practice good hygiene**: Wipe from front to back, avoid scented soaps and douches, and wear loose, breathable clothing.\n2. **Use condoms**: During sexual activity, use condoms to reduce the risk of transmission.\n3. **Maintain a healthy diet**: Eat a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.\n4. **Manage stress**: Engage in stress-reducing activities, such as yoga, meditation, or deep breathing exercises.\n5. **Get enough sleep**: Aim for 7-8 hours of sleep per night to help regulate your immune system.\n6. **Consider probiotics**: Take a probiotic supplement or eat probiotic-rich foods, like yogurt, to support the growth of good bacteria in your vagina.\n\n**When to see a doctor:**\nIf you experience frequent or severe yeast infections, or if you're unsure about the diagnosis, consult your healthcare provider. They can help you identify the underlying cause and provide guidance on treatment and prevention.\n\nRemember, it's essential to consult with a healthcare professional for proper diagnosis and treatment.

What causes them? I am 25 years old."}, {"text": "The likelihood of getting pregnant from having sex on the last day of your period depends on several factors, including the length of your menstrual cycle, the timing of ovulation, and the lifespan of sperm and eggs.\n\nIn general, it's considered unlikely to get pregnant from having sex on the last day of your period, but it's not impossible. Here's why:\n\n1. **Ovulation timing**: Most women ovulate around 14 days before their next period, which means that if you have a 28-day cycle, you'll likely ovulate around day 14. If you have sex on the last day of your period (day 5-7), you're still about 7-9 days away from ovulation.\n2. **Sperm lifespan**: Sperm can survive inside the female reproductive tract for up to 5-7 days. So, if you have sex on the last day of your period, the sperm may still be present when you ovulate, but their numbers will be decreasing.\n3. **Egg lifespan**: The egg is only viable for fertilization for about 24 hours after ovulation. If you ovulate 7-9 days after having sex on the last day of your period, the egg will likely be released after the sperm have died or are no longer viable.\n\nThat being said, there are some scenarios where getting pregnant from having sex on the last day of your period is more likely:\n\n* **Irregular cycles**: If you have irregular periods or a longer cycle, you may ovulate later than usual, increasing the chances of getting pregnant from having sex on the last day of your period.\n* **Early ovulation**: Some women may ovulate earlier than usual, which could increase the chances of getting pregnant from having sex on the last day of your period.\n* **Frequent or prolonged bleeding**: If you experience heavy or prolonged bleeding, it may be possible for sperm to survive inside the reproductive tract for longer than usual, increasing the chances of getting pregnant.\n\nTo give you a better estimate, a study published in the journal Fertility and Sterility found that the probability of getting pregnant from having sex on the last day of your period is around 2-3%. However, this probability increases to around 10-15% if you have sex 2-3 days after your period ends.\n\nKeep in mind that these are general estimates, and the likelihood of getting pregnant depends on individual factors, such as your overall health, fertility, and menstrual cycle.\n\nIf you're trying to avoid pregnancy, it's always best to use a reliable form of contraception, such as hormonal birth control, condoms, or a combination of both. If you're trying to get pregnant, it's recommended to have sex every other day during the fertile window, which is usually around 5-7 days leading up to ovulation and the day of ovulation itself.", "metadata": {"token_usage": {"completion_tokens": 585, "prompt_tokens": 36, "total_tokens": 621, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "model_name": "meta-llama/Llama-3-70b-chat-hf", "system_fingerprint": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "logprobs": null}, "prompt": "How likely am I to get pregnant if I have sex on the last day of my period?

They'll help determine if an IUD is right for you and answer any questions you may have.\n\nHere are some general guidelines to consider:\n\n**Eligibility:** Most women can get an IUD, including those who:\n\n1. Are at least 25 years old (like you!)\n2. Have had at least one child (not a requirement, but it can affect the type of IUD recommended)\n3. Are not pregnant or breastfeeding\n4. Do not have certain medical conditions, such as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), cervical cancer, or uterine anomalies\n5. Are not allergic to copper (if considering a copper IUD)\n\n**Types of IUDs:** There are two main types of IUDs:\n\n1. **Hormonal IUDs** (e.g., Mirena, Skyla, Liletta): These release a small amount of progestin, a hormone that thickens cervical mucus, making it harder for sperm to reach the egg. They're effective for 3-5 years.\n2. **Copper IUDs** (e.g., ParaGard): These contain copper, which is toxic to sperm, preventing fertilization. They're effective for 10 years.\n\n**Benefits:**\n\n1. **Highly effective:** IUDs are over 99% effective in preventing pregnancy.\n2. **Long-acting:** IUDs can provide years of protection without the need for daily or weekly maintenance.\n3. **Reversible:** IUDs can be removed at any time, and fertility returns quickly.\n4. **Low maintenance:** Once inserted, IUDs require minimal upkeep.\n\n**Potential side effects and considerations:**\n\n1. **Cramping and bleeding:** You may experience cramping and bleeding during the first few days after insertion.\n2. **Spotting:** Hormonal IUDs can cause spotting or light bleeding between periods.\n3. **Expulsion:** In rare cases, the IUD may be expelled from the uterus.\n4. **Perforation:** The IUD may perforate the uterus during insertion (rare).\n\n**Next steps:**\n\n1. Schedule a consultation with a healthcare provider to discuss your options and determine if an IUD is right for you.\n2.

If you're not sure when you ovulate, you can try tracking your menstrual cycle or using an ovulation predictor kit.\n2. **Sperm survival**: Sperm can survive inside the female reproductive tract for up to 5 days. If you had sex during this time, there's a chance that sperm could still be present when you ovulate.\n3. **Bleeding**: The bleeding you experienced after sex could be due to various reasons, including cervical irritation or hormonal changes.

They can detect the presence of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in your urine, which is produced during pregnancy. It's best to take a test about a week after missing your period for the most accurate results.\n3. **Consult a healthcare provider**: If you're experiencing bleeding, it's a good idea to consult a healthcare provider to rule out any underlying conditions. They can also perform a pregnancy test and provide guidance on next steps.\n\nIn the meantime, consider the following:\n\n* If you're not ready to become pregnant, you may want to consider emergency contraception, such as the morning-after pill (Plan B).

It's a normal part of sexual experience, and it's okay to communicate with your partner about what you need to feel more comfortable and aroused.\n\nIf you're concerned about your sexual function or would like to explore ways to improve your sexual experience, consider speaking with a healthcare provider or a sex therapist.

Similar to the diaphragm, but may be more difficult to use.\n4. **Other Options:**\n\t* **Shot (Depo-Provera):** A quarterly injection of progesterone. Effective, but may cause weight gain, mood changes, or bone density loss.\n\t* **Spermicides:** Chemicals that kill sperm, available in various forms (foam, gel, or suppositories). Not as effective as other methods, but can be used in combination with other methods.\n5. **Natural Family Planning (NFP) Methods:**\n\t* **Fertility Awareness Methods (FAMs):** Tracking basal body temperature, cervical mucus, and menstrual cycles to determine fertile windows.

Don't worry, I'm here to help you figure out what's going on.\n\nVaginal discharge is a normal and necessary part of a healthy reproductive system. It's produced by glands in the cervix and vagina to help keep the vagina clean and moist. The characteristics of normal discharge can vary from woman to woman, but here are some general guidelines:\n\n**Normal discharge:**\n\n* Color: Clear, white, or off-white\n* Consistency: Thin, watery, or slightly thick\n* Odor: Mild, slightly sweet, or neutral\n* Amount: Moderate, changing throughout the menstrual cycle\n\nNow, let's talk about your specific situation:\n\n**White and thick discharge:**\n\nA thick, white discharge can be normal, especially during certain times of your menstrual cycle. For example:\n\n* Right after your period, your body may produce more mucus to help clean out the uterus and vagina.\n* During ovulation (around day 14 of a 28-day cycle), your body produces more cervical mucus, which can be thicker and whiter.\n* If you're experiencing a surge in estrogen levels, your discharge may become thicker and more abundant.\n\nHowever, a thick, white discharge can also be a sign of an underlying issue, such as:\n\n* **Yeast infection (Candidiasis):** A fungal infection that can cause a thick, white, cottage cheese-like discharge, accompanied by itching, burning, and redness.\n* **Bacterial vaginosis (BV):** A bacterial infection that can cause a thick, white or grayish discharge, often with a strong, fishy odor.\n\n**Funny smell:**\n\nA mild, slightly sweet or neutral odor is normal. However, a strong, unpleasant smell can indicate an infection or imbalance. If you're experiencing a funny smell, it's possible that you have:\n\n* **Yeast infection (Candidiasis):** As mentioned earlier, yeast infections can cause a strong, unpleasant odor.\n* **Bacterial vaginosis (BV):** BV can cause a strong, fishy or metallic odor.\n* **Trichomoniasis:** A sexually transmitted infection (STI) that can cause a strong, unpleasant odor.\n\n**What to do:**\n\nIf you're concerned about your discharge or smell, it's always a good idea to consult with a healthcare provider, such as a gynecologist or primary care physician. They can:\n\n* Perform a pelvic exam to check for any signs of infection or inflammation.\n* Take a sample of your discharge to test for yeast, bacteria, or other infections.\n* Provide guidance on how to manage your symptoms and prevent future issues.\n\nIn the meantime, here are some general tips to help maintain a healthy vagina:\n\n* Practice good hygiene: Wash your genital area with mild soap and water.\n* Wear breathable clothing and underwear.\n* Avoid scented soaps, douches, or wipes, which can disrupt the natural balance of your vagina.\n* Stay hydrated to help your body produce healthy discharge.\n\nRemember, it's always better to err on the side of caution and consult with a healthcare provider if you're unsure about your symptoms.", "metadata": {"token_usage": {"completion_tokens": 645, "prompt_tokens": 33, "total_tokens": 678, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "model_name": "meta-llama/Llama-3-70b-chat-hf", "system_fingerprint": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "logprobs": null}, "prompt": "My discharge smells funny, and it's white and thick.

Hormonal changes: Fluctuations in hormone levels during puberty, pregnancy, or menopause can cause changes in the vulva's appearance.\n2. Childbirth: Vaginal deliveries can cause stretching or tearing of the perineum, leading to changes in the vulva's shape and color.\n3. Aging: As we age, the skin and tissues in the vulva can undergo natural changes, leading to a darker or more stretched appearance.\n4. Genetics: Your vulva's shape and color can be influenced by your genetic makeup.\n\nBefore considering surgery, it's essential to consult with a healthcare provider or gynecologist to discuss your concerns and rule out any underlying medical conditions that may be contributing to the changes you're experiencing. They can perform a physical examination and provide guidance on the best course of action.\n\nRegarding surgery, there are some procedures that can be performed to alter the appearance of the vulva, such as:\n\n1. Labiaplasty: A surgical procedure that reshapes or reduces the size of the labia minora (the inner lips of the vulva).\n2. Perineoplasty: A procedure that repairs or reconstructs the perineum (the area between the vagina and anus).\n\nHowever, it's crucial to note that these procedures are typically reserved for individuals who are experiencing functional issues, such as discomfort or pain, rather than solely for cosmetic reasons.

Use warm water and a mild soap that's gentle on your skin.\n2. **Clean your genital area**: Use a gentle soap and warm water to clean your genital area. Be sure to clean the folds of skin around your vagina or penis, as bacteria can accumulate in these areas.\n3. **Wipe correctly**: After using the bathroom, wipe from front to back to prevent bacteria from entering your urethra.\n\n**Maintain a Healthy Vaginal or Penile Environment:**\n\n1. **Wear breathable clothing**: Avoid tight-fitting clothing, especially synthetic fabrics like nylon or polyester, which can trap moisture and create an ideal environment for bacteria to grow. Opt for cotton or linen underwear instead.\n2. **Use gentle products**: Avoid using harsh soaps, douches, or scented products that can disrupt the natural balance of your genital area. Instead, use gentle, fragrance-free products that are designed for your genital area.\n3. **Keep your genital area dry**: After showering or bathing, gently pat the area dry with a clean towel. This can help prevent bacterial growth.\n\n**Additional Tips:**\n\n1. **Trim your pubic hair**: Excess pubic hair can trap sweat and bacteria, contributing to odor. Trimming your pubic hair can help keep the area clean and dry.\n2. **Wear clean clothes**: Change your underwear regularly, especially after exercising or sweating heavily.\n3. **Stay hydrated**: Drinking plenty of water can help flush out toxins and reduce sweat, which can contribute to odor.\n4. **Consider probiotics**: Probiotics can help maintain a healthy balance of bacteria in your genital area, which can reduce odor. You can find probiotics in foods like yogurt or take a supplement after consulting with your doctor.\n\n**When to Seek Medical Attention:**\n\nIf you've tried the above tips and the odor persists, it's a good idea to consult with your doctor or a healthcare provider.

If you're concerned about your menstrual cycle, it's always best to consult a healthcare provider for personalized advice.\n\nMissing periods, also known as amenorrhea, can be caused by a variety of factors. Since you're not pregnant, let's explore some other possible reasons:\n\n1. **Hormonal Imbalance**: Hormonal changes can affect ovulation and menstruation. Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), thyroid disorders, and hyperprolactinemia (elevated prolactin levels) are common hormonal imbalances that can cause irregular periods.\n2. **Weight Changes**: Significant weight gain or loss can disrupt menstrual cycles. If you've experienced a change in weight recently, this could be a contributing factor.\n3. **Stress**: High levels of stress can affect the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian (HPO) axis, leading to irregular periods. Chronic stress can also cause cortisol levels to rise, which can suppress ovulation.\n4. **Birth Control**: If you've recently stopped taking hormonal birth control, it may take some time for your body to regulate its natural hormonal balance, leading to irregular periods.\n5. **Medical Conditions**: Certain medical conditions, such as premature ovarian failure (POF), can cause amenorrhea. Other conditions like celiac disease, Crohn's disease, or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) can also affect menstrual cycles.\n6. **Medications**: Certain medications, such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, and blood pressure medications, can affect hormone levels and menstrual cycles.\n7. **Lifestyle Factors**: Excessive exercise, eating disorders, or a diet that is too low in calories or fat can disrupt menstrual cycles.\n8. **Pituitary Gland Problems**: Tumors or other issues with the pituitary gland can affect hormone production, leading to amenorrhea.\n\nTo better understand what might be causing your amenorrhea, consider the following:\n\n* Have you experienced any changes in your weight, appetite, or energy levels?\n* Have you been under significant stress or experienced any major life changes recently?\n* Have you started or stopped any medications recently?\n* Have you noticed any other symptoms, such as acne, hair loss, or changes in libido?\n\nIt's essential to consult a healthcare provider, such as a primary care physician or an obstetrician-gynecologist (OB-GYN), to discuss your symptoms and rule out any underlying medical conditions. They may perform a physical exam, take a detailed medical history, and order diagnostic tests, such as hormone level checks or imaging studies, to determine the cause of your amenorrhea.\n\nIn the meantime, consider keeping a menstrual cycle diary or using a period tracking app to monitor your symptoms and any changes you may experience.

You're on the pill, which is a hormonal contraceptive method that's highly effective in preventing pregnancy when used correctly. The pill works by preventing ovulation, thickening cervical mucus, and making it harder for sperm to reach the egg.\n\nHowever, when a condom breaks, there's a risk of sperm getting through, even if you're on the pill. The chances of getting pregnant in this scenario depend on several factors, including:\n\n1. **Timing**: When did you have sex, and where are you in your menstrual cycle? If you're in the fertile window (around ovulation), the risk of pregnancy is higher.\n2. **Condom breakage**: How soon after the condom broke did you realize it, and did you take any emergency contraception measures?\n3. **Pill effectiveness**: Are you taking your pill consistently and correctly? Missing pills or taking them irregularly can reduce their effectiveness.\n4. **Sperm quality and quantity**: The quality and quantity of sperm can affect the likelihood of fertilization.\n\nAssuming you're taking your pill correctly and consistently, the chances of getting pregnant are still relatively low. However, it's essential to take precautions to minimize the risk.\n\n**Estimated pregnancy risk:**\n\n* If you're in the fertile window (around ovulation), the risk of pregnancy is around 1-2% (1-2 pregnancies per 100 women).\n* If you're not in the fertile window, the risk is significantly lower, around 0.1-0.5% (1-5 pregnancies per 1,000 women).\n\n**What to do next:**\n\n1. **Take a pregnancy test**: Wait at least 7-10 days after the broken condom incident to take a home pregnancy test (HPT). If you get a negative result, it's likely you're not pregnant.\n2. **Consider emergency contraception**: If you're concerned about pregnancy, you can take emergency contraception like Plan B (levonorgestrel) or Ella (ulipristal acetate) within 72 hours of the broken condom. These medications can help prevent pregnancy by delaying ovulation or preventing fertilization.\n3. **Continue taking your pill**: Keep taking your pill as usual to maintain its effectiveness.\n4. **Consult a healthcare provider**: If you're still concerned about pregnancy or have questions, schedule an appointment with your healthcare provider or a reproductive health specialist.\n\nRemember, it's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to contraception and pregnancy prevention.

Here's a clear explanation:\n\n**Puberty Blockers:**\n\nPuberty blockers, also known as gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues, are medications that temporarily pause or suppress the onset of puberty. They are typically used in transgender youth, usually between the ages of 10 to 16, to delay the physical changes associated with puberty. This allows the individual to explore their gender identity without the irreversible physical changes that come with puberty.\n\nPuberty blockers work by blocking the production of sex hormones (estrogen and testosterone) that trigger puberty. By doing so, they prevent the development of secondary sex characteristics, such as breast growth, facial hair, or voice deepening.\n\n**Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT):**\n\nHormone Replacement Therapy, on the other hand, is a medical treatment used to align a person's physical body with their gender identity. HRT involves taking hormones to replace or supplement the body's natural hormone production. The goal of HRT is to induce the physical changes associated with the desired gender.\n\nFor transgender individuals, HRT typically involves:\n\n* Masculinizing HRT (M-HRT): Taking testosterone to induce masculine physical characteristics, such as facial hair, deepening of the voice, and muscle growth.\n* Feminizing HRT (F-HRT): Taking estrogen and anti-androgens to induce feminine physical characteristics, such as breast growth, softer skin, and redistribution of body fat.\n\nHRT is usually started after puberty blockers, if necessary, and is often a long-term treatment. It's essential to note that HRT is a serious medical treatment that requires careful monitoring and management by a qualified healthcare provider.\n\n**Key differences:**\n\n1. **Purpose:** Puberty blockers delay puberty, while HRT induces physical changes to align with a person's gender identity.\n2. **Age:** Puberty blockers are typically used in youth, while HRT can be started at various ages, including in adulthood.\n3. **Duration:** Puberty blockers are usually temporary, while HRT is often a long-term treatment.\n4. **Effects:** Puberty blockers prevent puberty from progressing, while HRT induces physical changes associated with the desired gender.\n\nAs a 25-year-old, you may be considering HRT as part of your gender-affirming care.

Like all hormonal contraceptives, it carries a risk of blood clotting and related health issues. However, it's essential to understand that the risk is relatively low, especially for healthy women like yourself at 25 years old.\n\nThe risk of blood clotting associated with NuvaRing is primarily related to the estrogen component. Estrogen can increase the production of clotting factors in the liver, which can lead to an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE), including deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE).\n\nAccording to the FDA, the risk of VTE associated with NuvaRing is estimated to be around 3-9 cases per 10,000 women per year. To put this into perspective:\n\n* The overall risk of VTE in women of childbearing age (15-44 years) is about 1-2 cases per 10,000 women per year.\n* The risk of VTE associated with pregnancy is around 5-20 cases per 10,000 women per year.\n* The risk of VTE associated with hormonal contraceptives, including NuvaRing, is higher than the overall risk in women of childbearing age but lower than the risk associated with pregnancy.\n\nIt's important to note that the risk of VTE associated with NuvaRing is highest during the first year of use and decreases over time. Additionally, the risk is higher in women who have other underlying risk factors, such as:\n\n* Family history of VTE\n* Obesity\n* Smoking\n* Immobility (e.g., prolonged bed rest or travel)\n* Cancer\n* Inflammatory bowel disease\n* Recent surgery or trauma\n\nTo minimize the risk of blood clotting and related health issues while using NuvaRing, it's essential to:\n\n* Inform your healthcare provider about any underlying medical conditions or risk factors.\n* Be aware of the signs and symptoms of VTE, such as:\n\t+ Leg pain or swelling\n\t+ Shortness of breath\n\t+ Chest pain or coughing up blood\n\t+ Severe headache or vision changes\n* Seek medical attention immediately if you experience any of these symptoms.\n* Follow your healthcare provider's instructions for using NuvaRing, and attend regular check-ups to monitor your health.\n\nOverall, while there is a risk of blood clotting associated with NuvaRing, it's relatively low, especially for healthy women like yourself at 25 years old.

This means it was put on before sex, didn't slip or break, and was removed carefully after sex.\n2. **Condom quality**: The quality of the condom can affect its effectiveness. Expired or damaged condoms are more likely to fail.\n3. **Frequency of sex**: If you had sex multiple times with the same condom, the risk of pregnancy increases.\n\nAccording to the American Pregnancy Association, the failure rate of condoms is around 2% with perfect use and 15% with typical use.\n\nGiven your situation, it's possible that you might be pregnant, but it's also possible that your period is late due to other factors, such as:\n\n1. **Hormonal changes**: Hormonal fluctuations can affect your menstrual cycle, causing delays or irregularities.\n2. **Stress**: High levels of stress can disrupt your menstrual cycle.\n3. **Weight changes**: Significant weight gain or loss can affect your period.\n4. **Other medical conditions**: Certain medical conditions, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), thyroid disorders, or pituitary gland problems, can cause irregular periods.\n\nWhat to do next:\n\n1. **Take a pregnancy test**: If you're concerned about pregnancy, take a home pregnancy test (HPT) about a week after your missed period. If the result is negative and your period still doesn't arrive, take another test a few days later.\n2. **Consult a healthcare provider**: If you get a positive result or your period is still late after taking multiple tests, schedule an appointment with your healthcare provider.

If you're sexually active, it's essential to consider other forms of contraception, such as hormonal methods (e.g., the pill, patch, or ring) or intrauterine devices (IUDs), in addition to using condoms.", "metadata": {"token_usage": {"completion_tokens": 449, "prompt_tokens": 30, "total_tokens": 479, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "model_name": "meta-llama/Llama-3-70b-chat-hf", "system_fingerprint": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "logprobs": null}, "prompt": "What are my chances of getting pregnant if I use a condom?

Here are some possible effects to consider:\n\n**Hormonal changes:**\n\n* Decreased estrogen levels: The ovaries produce estrogen, a hormone that regulates various bodily functions, including menstruation, fertility, and bone density. With one ovary removed, your estrogen levels may decrease, leading to:\n\t+ Changes in menstrual cycles: Your periods may become irregular, lighter, or heavier.\n\t+ Hot flashes and night sweats: You may experience these symptoms, especially if both ovaries are removed.\n\t+ Vaginal dryness: Decreased estrogen can cause vaginal dryness, itching, or pain during sex.\n* Increased risk of osteoporosis: Estrogen helps maintain bone density. With lower estrogen levels, you may be at a higher risk of developing osteoporosis, particularly if you're not taking hormone replacement therapy (HRT).\n\n**Fertility and pregnancy:**\n\n* Reduced fertility: Removing one ovary can reduce your chances of getting pregnant, as you'll have fewer eggs available for fertilization. However, you may still be able to conceive with the remaining ovary.\n* Increased risk of infertility: If both ovaries are removed, you will no longer be able to conceive naturally.\n\n**Emotional and psychological effects:**\n\n* Emotional distress: Losing an ovary can be a significant life event, leading to feelings of grief, anxiety, or depression.\n* Body image changes: You may experience changes in your body shape or size, which can affect your self-esteem and confidence.\n\n**Other potential effects:**\n\n* Increased risk of heart disease: Estrogen helps protect against heart disease. With lower estrogen levels, your risk of heart disease may increase.\n* Changes in libido: Decreased estrogen levels can lead to a decrease in libido (sex drive).\n* Weight gain: Hormonal changes can cause weight gain, particularly around the midsection.\n\n**What to expect after surgery:**\n\n* Recovery time: The recovery period after an oophorectomy can take several weeks to a few months.\n* Follow-up care: Your healthcare provider will schedule follow-up appointments to monitor your recovery and address any concerns or complications.\n* Hormone replacement therapy (HRT): Your healthcare provider may recommend HRT to manage hormonal changes and alleviate symptoms.\n\n**Important considerations:**\n\n* If you're considering having children, you may want to discuss fertility preservation options with your healthcare provider, such as egg freezing or embryo freezing.\n* If you're experiencing symptoms like hot flashes, vaginal dryness, or mood changes, talk to your healthcare provider about potential treatments or HRT options.\n\nIt's essential to discuss your individual situation and any concerns with your healthcare provider.

This can lead to hot flashes, among other symptoms.\n3. **Thyroid disorders**: An underactive or overactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism) can cause hot flashes, as well as other symptoms like mood changes, fatigue, and weight changes.\n4. **Anxiety or stress**: High levels of stress and anxiety can trigger hot flashes in some people. This is because stress can affect hormone levels and blood flow.\n5. **Medications**: Certain medications, such as antidepressants, blood pressure medications, and hormone replacement therapy, can cause hot flashes as a side effect.\n6. **Other medical conditions**: Certain medical conditions, like multiple sclerosis, lupus, or rheumatoid arthritis, can cause hot flashes.\n7. **Diet and lifestyle**: Consuming spicy foods, caffeine, or alcohol can trigger hot flashes in some individuals.

Nerve stimulation: The nerves that control the penis can be stimulated by various activities, like exercise, stretching, or even a full bladder.\n3. Reflexes: Certain reflexes, like the \"bulbocavernosus reflex,\" can cause erections in response to stimulation of the penis or surrounding areas.\n\n**Frequency:** The frequency of these non-arousal-related erections can vary greatly from person to person. Some men may experience them several times a day, while others may not notice them as frequently.\n\n**Age:** As you're 25, you're likely to experience more frequent erections due to your age. Erections tend to be more frequent in younger men, and their frequency often decreases with age.\n\n**What's normal?** It's essential to remember that experiencing erections when not sexually aroused is a normal part of male physiology. If you're concerned about the frequency or persistence of your erections, it's always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional to rule out any underlying medical conditions.\n\nIn summary, it's common for men to experience erections when not sexually aroused, and the frequency can vary greatly from person to person.

Testosterone, indeed, plays a significant role in sexual desire, but the relationship is more complex than a simple cause-and-effect.\n\n**Testosterone and sexual desire:**\n\nTestosterone is a hormone that regulates various physiological processes, including libido, or sexual desire. In men, testosterone levels typically peak during adolescence and early adulthood, around the age of 20. After that, levels gradually decline with age.\n\nResearch suggests that testosterone levels can influence sexual desire, but the impact is not always straightforward. Here are some key points to consider:\n\n1. **Low testosterone levels can affect libido:** Studies have shown that men with low testosterone levels (hypogonadism) often experience decreased sexual desire, erectile dysfunction, and reduced sexual activity.\n2. **But, not all men with low testosterone experience low libido:** Some men with low testosterone levels may not experience a significant decrease in sexual desire. This suggests that other factors, such as overall health, relationships, and psychological well-being, also play a role in sexual desire.\n3. **Testosterone levels can fluctuate:** Testosterone levels can vary throughout the day, with peaks in the morning and decreases at night. This natural fluctuation can affect sexual desire, even in men with normal testosterone levels.\n4. **Other factors influence sexual desire:** Sexual desire is a complex phenomenon influenced by multiple factors, including:\n\t* Relationship quality and intimacy\n\t* Stress and anxiety\n\t* Sleep quality and duration\n\t* Overall physical and mental health\n\t* Medications and substance use\n\t* Hormonal imbalances (e.g., thyroid issues)\n\n**What to do if you're concerned about your sexual desire:**\n\nIf you're experiencing a decrease in sexual desire, it's essential to consult with a healthcare professional to rule out any underlying medical conditions. They may perform a physical exam, take a detailed medical history, and order blood tests to check your testosterone levels and overall health.\n\nIn the meantime, here are some lifestyle changes that may help:\n\n1. **Maintain a healthy weight:** Excess weight can contribute to low testosterone levels.\n2. **Exercise regularly:** Regular exercise, especially weightlifting and high-intensity interval training, can help boost testosterone levels.\n3. **Get enough sleep:** Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep per night to help regulate testosterone levels.\n4. **Manage stress:** Engage in stress-reducing activities, such as meditation, yoga, or deep breathing exercises.\n5. **Foster a healthy relationship:** Work on building a strong, intimate connection with your partner.\n\nRemember, it's essential to have an open and honest conversation with your healthcare provider about your concerns.

As a 25-year-old, you're not alone in experiencing this discomfort. Let's explore some possible reasons behind it:\n\n1. **Urinary Tract Infection (UTI)**: Sex can push bacteria from the vagina into the urethra, leading to a UTI. This can cause burning sensations while urinating, as well as frequent urination, pelvic pain, and blood in the urine.\n2. **Irritation or Inflammation**: Friction during sex can cause micro-tears in the urethra, leading to inflammation and pain while urinating. This is more common in women, especially if they're not lubricated enough or if their partner is larger than average.\n3. **Vaginal Dryness**: Insufficient lubrication during sex can cause friction, leading to vaginal dryness and irritation. This can result in pain while urinating, as well as discomfort during sex.\n4. **Sexually Transmitted Infections (STIs)**: Certain STIs, such as chlamydia, gonorrhea, or herpes, can cause painful urination, along with other symptoms like abnormal discharge, itching, or sores.\n5. **Yeast Infections**: Vaginal yeast infections can cause burning sensations while urinating, as well as itching, redness, and thick, white discharge.\n6. **Hormonal Changes**: Hormonal fluctuations during the menstrual cycle or with birth control methods can lead to changes in vaginal pH, causing irritation and pain while urinating.\n7. **Anatomical Issues**: In some cases, pain while urinating after sex can be related to anatomical issues, such as a urethral stricture (narrowing of the urethra) or a vaginal septum (a thin wall of tissue that divides the vagina).\n\nTo alleviate the discomfort, try the following:\n\n1. **Stay hydrated**: Drink plenty of water to help flush out bacteria and reduce the risk of UTIs.\n2. **Urinate after sex**: Emptying your bladder after sex can help reduce the risk of UTIs by flushing out bacteria.\n3. **Practice good hygiene**: Wipe from front to back, and avoid using scented soaps or douches, which can irritate the urethra and vagina.\n4. **Use lubricants**: Apply lubricants during sex to reduce friction and prevent vaginal dryness.\n5. **Avoid tight clothing**: Wear loose, breathable clothing to help prevent bacterial growth and irritation.\n6. **Consider over-the-counter pain relief**: If the pain is mild, you can try taking an over-the-counter pain reliever like ibuprofen or acetaminophen.\n\nIf the pain persists or is severe, it's essential to consult a healthcare provider to rule out any underlying infections or conditions.

I'm here to help you understand the difference between orgasm and urination.\n\n**Orgasm:**\n\nAn orgasm is a intense, pleasurable sensation that occurs during sexual arousal, typically accompanied by muscle contractions in the pelvic area. During orgasm, the muscles in the pelvic floor, including the pubococcygeus muscle (PC muscle), contract and release in a rhythmic manner. This can lead to a feeling of intense pleasure, relaxation, and sometimes, a sense of euphoria.\n\n**Urination:**\n\nUrination, on the other hand, is the process of expelling urine from the body through the urethra. When you urinate, your bladder muscles contract, and the urethral sphincter relaxes, allowing urine to flow out of the body.\n\n**Key differences:**\n\nHere are some key differences to help you distinguish between orgasm and urination:\n\n1. **Sensation:** Orgasm is typically accompanied by a pleasurable, intense sensation, while urination is a more neutral or sometimes uncomfortable sensation.\n2. **Muscle contractions:** During orgasm, the pelvic floor muscles contract and release in a rhythmic manner, whereas during urination, the bladder muscles contract, and the urethral sphincter relaxes.\n3. **Urine flow:** Urination involves the flow of urine out of the body, whereas orgasm does not involve the release of urine.\n4. **Location:** The sensations associated with orgasm are typically felt in the pelvic area, genitals, and sometimes, the entire body. Urination, on the other hand, is felt in the urethra and bladder area.\n5. **Control:** You have more control over urination, as you can usually stop the flow of urine by contracting the urethral sphincter. Orgasm, while influenced by sexual arousal, is a more involuntary response.\n\n**Tips to help you distinguish:**\n\n1. **Pay attention to your body:** Take note of the sensations you experience during sexual arousal and orgasm. Notice the muscle contractions, the intensity of the pleasure, and the overall feeling.\n2. **Practice pelvic floor exercises:** Engage in Kegel exercises to strengthen your pelvic floor muscles, which can help you better understand the sensations associated with orgasm.\n3. **Communicate with your partner:** If you're experiencing sexual activity with a partner, communicate with them about your feelings and sensations.

As a 25-year-old, you're still in your prime reproductive years, and there are many factors that could be influencing your ability to conceive.\n\nBefore we dive into potential reasons, let's cover some basics:\n\n1. **Ovulation and timing**: Are you tracking your ovulation and having regular, unprotected sex during your fertile window (usually 5-7 days leading up to ovulation and the day of ovulation itself)?\n2. **Menstrual cycle**: Are your periods regular, heavy, and lasting around 3-7 days? Any irregularities or abnormalities could affect ovulation and fertility.\n3. **Overall health**: Are you maintaining a healthy weight, eating a balanced diet, and exercising regularly? Any underlying medical conditions or lifestyle factors could impact fertility.\n\nNow, let's explore some potential reasons why you might not be getting pregnant yet:\n\n1. **Stress**: High levels of stress can affect ovulation and hormone regulation. Try relaxation techniques like yoga, meditation, or deep breathing exercises.\n2. **Hormonal imbalances**: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), thyroid issues, or other hormonal imbalances can impact ovulation and fertility. Consult your doctor about getting tested.\n3. **Low sperm count or quality**: If your partner's sperm count is low or the sperm are not healthy, it can reduce the chances of conception.\n4. **Blocked fallopian tubes**: If your fallopian tubes are blocked or damaged, it can prevent the sperm from reaching the egg.\n5. **Endometriosis**: This condition can cause inflammation and scarring in the reproductive tract, making it harder to conceive.\n6. **Age**: While 25 is still a great age for fertility, women's fertility does decline with age. If you're concerned, consider speaking with a fertility specialist.\n7. **Lifestyle factors**: Smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, and certain medications can affect fertility.\n\nWhat can you do next?\n\n1. **Schedule a preconception checkup**: Visit your primary care physician or OB-GYN to discuss your fertility concerns and get a thorough checkup.\n2. **Track your ovulation**: Use a basal body thermometer, ovulation predictor kits, or apps like Clue or Flo to monitor your ovulation and fertile window.\n3. **Maintain a healthy lifestyle**: Focus on a balanced diet, regular exercise, and stress management techniques.\n4. **Consider fertility testing**: If you've been trying for 6-12 months without success, your doctor may recommend fertility testing for you and your partner.\n\nRemember, it's essential to be patient and not stress too much about getting pregnant.

Here's why:\n\n1. **Asymptomatic shedding**: Herpes simplex virus (HSV) can shed from the skin even when there are no visible symptoms. This means you can still transmit the virus to others, even if you're not experiencing any outbreaks.\n2. **Latent phase**: After the initial infection, HSV can enter a latent phase, where the virus remains dormant in the nerve cells. During this phase, you may not experience any symptoms, but the virus is still present in your body.\n3. **False negatives**: If you were tested for herpes using a blood test, it's possible that the test result was a false negative. This can occur if the test was taken too soon after exposure, or if the test is not sensitive enough to detect the antibodies.\n4. **Window period**: There's a window period between the time of exposure and the development of antibodies, which can take several weeks to a few months. If you were tested during this window period, the test result may not have detected the antibodies yet.\n\nTo clarify your diagnosis, you may want to consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Get re-tested**: Ask your healthcare provider to re-test you using a different type of test, such as a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test, which can detect the virus's genetic material.\n2. **Discuss your symptoms (or lack thereof)**: Talk to your healthcare provider about your lack of symptoms. They may want to perform a physical examination or ask more questions about your sexual history to help determine the likelihood of a false positive diagnosis.\n3. **Get a second opinion**: If you're still unsure about your diagnosis, consider seeking a second opinion from a different healthcare provider or a specialist in infectious diseases.\n\nRemember, herpes is a common and manageable condition.

These pathogens can be present in the water, and sexual activity can increase the risk of transmission. This is especially concerning for people with weakened immune systems.\n2. **Bacterial vaginosis (BV) and urinary tract infections (UTIs)**: The warm, moist environment of a hot spring can increase the risk of BV and UTIs. Sexual activity in a hot spring can push bacteria into the urethra, leading to infections.\n3. **Sexually transmitted infections (STIs)**: Engaging in sexual activity in a hot spring does not provide any protection against STIs, such as chlamydia, gonorrhea, or HIV. It's essential to practice safe sex and use condoms or other forms of protection.\n4. **Skin and eye irritation**: The high temperatures and mineral content of hot springs can cause skin and eye irritation. This may be exacerbated by sexual activity, which can increase friction and skin-to-skin contact.\n5. **Slippery surfaces**: Hot springs can be slippery, which increases the risk of accidents and injuries. This is particularly concerning during sexual activity, as it may lead to unintended consequences.\n6. **Privacy and consent**: Hot springs are often public areas, and engaging in sexual activity may not be appropriate or respectful to other visitors. Ensure you have the necessary privacy and consent from all parties involved.\n7. **Water quality**: The water quality in natural hot springs can vary greatly. Poor water quality can lead to infections, skin irritation, or other health issues.\n8. **Pregnancy and contraception**: If you're not using contraception or are trying to conceive, sexual activity in a hot spring may not be the best idea.

They're 98% effective in preventing pregnancy and also protect against sexually transmitted infections (STIs).\n2. **Vasectomy**: A vasectomy is a surgical procedure that involves cutting and sealing the vas deferens, the tubes that carry sperm. It's a permanent form of birth control and is nearly 100% effective. However, it's a significant decision and should be considered carefully.\n3. **Withdrawal (Coitus Interruptus)**: This method involves withdrawing the penis from the vagina before ejaculation. While it's not the most effective method, it can be used in conjunction with other methods.

Cervical cancer is primarily caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV), which is usually spread through sexual contact.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and ACOG recommend that women who have never been sexually active may not need a Pap smear until they become sexually active or until they turn 30, whichever comes first.\n\nSo, in your case, since you're 25 and a virgin, you might not need a Pap smear just yet. However, it's still important to establish a relationship with a healthcare provider and discuss your individual needs and risk factors.\n\nWhen you do become sexually active, it's essential to start getting regular Pap smears to ensure your cervical health. Additionally, if you have any concerns or questions about your reproductive health, don't hesitate to reach out to your healthcare provider.\n\nSources:\n\n* American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.

Diabetes can indeed affect sex, but the good news is that with proper management and awareness, you can minimize its impact.\n\nHere are some ways diabetes can affect sex:\n\n1. **Erectile dysfunction (ED):** High blood sugar levels over time can damage blood vessels and nerves, leading to ED. This is more common in men with uncontrolled diabetes.\n2. **Low libido:** High blood sugar, fatigue, and emotional stress related to diabetes management can lead to decreased sexual desire.\n3. **Vaginal dryness and pain:** Women with diabetes may experience vaginal dryness, itching, or pain during sex due to hormonal changes and nerve damage.\n4. **Neuropathy:** Nerve damage (neuropathy) can cause numbness, tingling, or pain in the genitals, making sex uncomfortable or even painful.\n5. **Hormonal changes:** Diabetes can affect hormone levels, leading to changes in sexual function and desire.\n6. **Medication side effects:** Certain diabetes medications, such as metformin, can cause sexual side effects like decreased libido or ED.\n7. **Emotional factors:** Living with diabetes can lead to anxiety, depression, and stress, which can negatively impact sexual relationships and overall well-being.\n\nHowever, there are many ways to manage these effects and maintain a healthy sex life:\n\n1. **Control your blood sugar:** Keeping your blood sugar levels within a healthy range can help prevent or reduce sexual problems.\n2. **Communicate with your partner:** Openly discuss your feelings, needs, and concerns with your partner to build a stronger and more supportive relationship.\n3. **Stay physically active:** Regular exercise can improve overall health, reduce stress, and boost mood.\n4. **Manage stress:** Engage in stress-reducing activities like yoga, meditation, or deep breathing exercises.\n5. **Get enough sleep:** Aim for 7-8 hours of sleep per night to help regulate hormones and improve overall health.\n6. **Seek professional help:** Consult with a healthcare provider, sex therapist, or counselor to address any sexual concerns or emotional challenges.\n7. **Explore intimacy beyond sex:** Focus on emotional intimacy, affection, and connection with your partner to maintain a fulfilling relationship.\n\nRemember, you're not alone in this.

It's always best to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.\n\nA breast lump that appears each month, also known as a cyclical breast lump, is a common phenomenon in many women. In most cases, it's not a cause for concern, but it's essential to have it evaluated by a healthcare professional to rule out any underlying conditions.\n\nThere are several possible explanations for a cyclical breast lump:\n\n1. **Hormonal fluctuations**: Breast tissue is sensitive to hormonal changes, which can cause breast tenderness, swelling, and lumpiness. This is especially common in the premenstrual phase of the menstrual cycle.\n2. **Fibrocystic breast changes**: This is a benign condition characterized by the formation of fluid-filled cysts and fibrous tissue in the breasts. It's often accompanied by breast tenderness, swelling, and lumpiness, which can worsen before menstruation.\n3. **Breast cysts**: These are fluid-filled sacs that can develop in the breasts. They're usually benign and may be tender or painful, especially before menstruation.\n\nTo put your mind at ease, it's a good idea to schedule an appointment with your primary care physician or a gynecologist. They will likely perform a physical examination, take a detailed medical history, and may order imaging tests (such as a mammogram or ultrasound) to evaluate the lump.\n\nIn the meantime, here are some things you can do:\n\n* **Keep track of your symptoms**: Record the timing and characteristics of the lump, including its size, shape, and any associated symptoms like pain or tenderness.\n* **Perform breast self-exams**: Regularly check your breasts for any changes or abnormalities. This can help you become more familiar with your breast tissue and detect any changes early on.\n* **Maintain a healthy lifestyle**: Eat a balanced diet, exercise regularly, and manage stress to help regulate your hormones and overall health.\n\nRemember, it's always better to err on the side of caution when it comes to breast health.

As a 25-year-old, you're considered an adult, and the procedure is a bit different from what it would be for an infant or child. Here's what you can expect:\n\n**Why might you consider a circumcision?**\n\nYou may be considering a circumcision for various reasons, such as:\n\n1. Personal hygiene: Some men find it easier to keep their penis clean without a foreskin.\n2. Sexual function: A circumcision can improve sexual sensation and reduce the risk of certain sexual health issues, like phimosis (a condition where the foreskin becomes too tight).\n3. Medical conditions: You may have a condition like balanitis (inflammation of the glans penis) or paraphimosis (a condition where the foreskin becomes stuck behind the head of the penis).\n4. Religious or cultural reasons: Circumcision is a common practice in some religions and cultures.\n\n**The procedure:**\n\nThe circumcision procedure for an adult is typically performed under local anesthesia, which numbs the penis and surrounding area. You may also be offered sedation to help you relax.\n\nHere's a general overview of the procedure:\n\n1. Preparation: You'll be asked to undress and lie on an examination table. Your penis will be cleaned and prepared for the procedure.\n2. Anesthesia: The local anesthetic will be injected into the penis to numb the area.\n3. Incision: The surgeon will make a small incision to remove the foreskin. There are different techniques used, but the most common one is the sleeve resection method, where the foreskin is removed in a circular motion.\n4. Stitches: The incision will be closed with stitches, which will dissolve on their own within a week or two.\n5. Recovery: You'll be taken to a recovery area to rest for about an hour before being discharged.\n\n**Recovery and aftercare:**\n\nThe recovery process typically takes a few days to a week. Here's what you can expect:\n\n1. Pain: You may experience some discomfort, pain, or swelling in the penis and surrounding area. Your doctor will prescribe pain medication to help manage this.\n2. Swelling and bruising: The penis and surrounding area may be swollen and bruised for a few days.\n3. Wound care: You'll need to keep the wound clean and dry to promote healing. Your doctor will provide instructions on how to do this.\n4. Rest: Avoid strenuous activities, such as heavy lifting, bending, or exercise, for a few days.\n5. Follow-up: You'll need to follow up with your doctor to remove the stitches (if they're not dissolvable) and to check on the healing process.\n\n**Risks and complications:**\n\nAs with any surgical procedure, there are risks and complications associated with circumcision. These include:\n\n1. Bleeding or hematoma\n2. Infection\n3. Scarring\n4. Nerve damage\n5. Changes in sensation or sexual function\n\nIt's essential to discuss these risks and complications with your doctor before undergoing the procedure.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nA circumcision is a relatively common procedure, and most men experience a smooth recovery.

If you're unsure about your size, you can consult a doctor or try a few different sizes to find the one that fits comfortably.\n2. **Material**: Condoms are made from latex, polyurethane, or lambskin. Latex is the most common and effective material, but if you have a latex allergy, polyurethane or lambskin might be a better option.\n3. **Thickness**: Thicker condoms can provide extra protection, but may reduce sensitivity. Thinner condoms can increase sensitivity, but may not be as effective.\n4. **Lubrication**: Some condoms come with lubrication, which can help reduce friction and increase pleasure.\n5. **Special features**: Some condoms have special features like ribbing, studded, or flavored coatings.\n\nBased on these factors, here are some popular condom types that might work for you:\n\n1. **Durex Ultra Thin**: A popular choice among men, these condoms are thin, lubricated, and made from latex.\n2. **Trojan Magnum**: If you need a larger size, Trojan Magnum condoms are a good option. They're also lubricated and made from latex.\n3. **Skyn**: If you're looking for a non-latex option, Skyn condoms are made from polyurethane and are known for their comfort and sensitivity.\n4. **Lifestyles Ultra Sensitive**: These condoms are thin, lubricated, and designed for maximum sensitivity.\n\nRemember, the most important thing is to choose a condom that fits comfortably and provides adequate protection against STIs and unintended pregnancy.\n\nIf you're still unsure, you can:\n\n* Consult a healthcare professional or a sex therapist for personalized advice.\n* Try out different types of condoms to see what works best for you.\n* Check out online reviews and ratings to get an idea of what other users think about a particular condom type.\n\nStay safe and happy!", "metadata": {"token_usage": {"completion_tokens": 467, "prompt_tokens": 26, "total_tokens": 493, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "model_name": "meta-llama/Llama-3-70b-chat-hf", "system_fingerprint": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "logprobs": null}, "prompt": "Which type of condom will work for me?

There are several possible reasons why this might be happening, and it's not uncommon for people to experience anorgasmia at some point in their lives. Here are some potential factors to consider:\n\n1. **Hormonal imbalance**: Hormonal changes, particularly low testosterone levels, can affect sexual function and orgasm. This is more common in older men, but it can occur at any age.\n2. **Neurological factors**: Issues with the nervous system, such as nerve damage or neurological disorders (e.g., multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease), can disrupt the normal sexual response cycle, leading to anorgasmia.\n3. **Medications**: Certain medications, like antidepressants, antihistamines, and blood pressure medications, can affect sexual function and orgasm.\n4. **Psychological factors**: Performance anxiety, stress, depression, and relationship issues can all contribute to anorgasmia.\n5. **Lifestyle factors**: Lack of sleep, excessive exercise, and substance abuse can affect sexual function and orgasm.\n6. **Sexual technique**: Inadequate sexual stimulation, poor communication with your partner, or unrealistic expectations can lead to anorgasmia.\n7. **Underlying medical conditions**: Certain medical conditions, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and cardiovascular disease, can affect blood flow and nerve function, leading to anorgasmia.\n8. **Trauma or past experiences**: Traumatic experiences or past sexual trauma can lead to anorgasmia.\n\nTo address your issue, consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Consult a healthcare professional**: Talk to your primary care physician or a urologist about your symptoms. They can help rule out underlying medical conditions and provide guidance on next steps.\n2. **Keep a sexual diary**: Tracking your sexual activity, including the frequency, duration, and any factors that might affect your orgasm, can help identify patterns and potential causes.\n3. **Practice relaxation techniques**: Stress and anxiety can exacerbate anorgasmia. Engage in relaxation techniques like meditation, deep breathing, or yoga to help manage stress.\n4. **Communicate with your partner**: Openly discuss your concerns with your partner and work together to find ways to improve your sexual experience.\n5. **Explore sexual therapy**: A sex therapist can help you address any psychological or relationship issues that might be contributing to anorgasmia.\n\nRemember, anorgasmia is a common issue that can be addressed with the right guidance and support.

At 25, you're still relatively young, and your breast tissue is likely still quite elastic.\n\nHere are some facts to consider:\n\n1. **Gravity**: Breast sagging is a natural process that occurs over time due to gravity's constant pull. Even with a bra, breasts will eventually sag to some extent.\n2. **Hormonal changes**: Hormonal fluctuations during pregnancy, breastfeeding, and menopause can cause breast tissue to stretch and lose elasticity, leading to sagging.\n3. **Genetics**: Your genetic makeup can influence the shape and size of your breasts, as well as their tendency to sag.\n4. **Weight gain or loss**: Significant weight changes can cause breast tissue to stretch or shrink, leading to sagging.\n5. **Age**: As you age, your skin and breast tissue naturally lose elasticity, leading to sagging.\n6. **Smoking**: Smoking can reduce blood flow to the skin and cause it to lose elasticity, contributing to sagging breasts.\n7. **Pregnancy and breastfeeding**: These can cause breast tissue to stretch and lose elasticity, leading to sagging.\n\nNow, about not wearing a bra:\n\nWhile not wearing a bra won't directly cause breast sagging, it may contribute to it over time. A bra provides support and helps distribute the weight of your breasts more evenly, which can help reduce the strain on your skin and breast tissue. Without a bra, your breasts may bounce and move more freely, which can cause the skin and tissue to stretch and lose elasticity faster.\n\nHowever, it's essential to note that the impact of not wearing a bra on breast sagging is relatively small compared to other factors like genetics, hormonal changes, and aging.\n\nTo minimize breast sagging, you can:\n\n* Wear a well-fitting bra that provides good support, especially during exercise or activities that involve heavy breast movement.\n* Maintain a healthy weight to reduce the strain on your skin and breast tissue.\n* Avoid smoking and excessive sun exposure, which can damage your skin and contribute to sagging.\n* Consider incorporating exercises that target the pectoral muscles, which can help improve breast lift and firmness.\n\nRemember, breast sagging is a natural process that occurs over time, and it's not possible to completely prevent it.

There are two types of HSV: HSV-1 and HSV-2. HSV-1 is the primary cause of cold sores on the mouth, while HSV-2 is more commonly associated with genital herpes.\n\nHere's how you might have contracted HSV-1:\n\n1. **Childhood exposure**: You may have been infected with HSV-1 during childhood, possibly through contact with a family member or friend who had a cold sore.\n2. **Skin-to-skin contact**: HSV-1 can be spread through skin-to-skin contact with someone who has a cold sore, even if they don't have any visible symptoms.\n3. **Sharing personal items**: Sharing utensils, towels, or lip balm with someone who has a cold sore can also transmit the virus.\n4. **Kissing**: Kissing someone who has a cold sore can spread the virus.\n\nOnce you're infected with HSV-1, the virus remains dormant in your nerve cells. When the virus is reactivated, it travels back to your skin, causing a cold sore to form.\n\nTriggers that can reactivate HSV-1 and cause cold sores include:\n\n1. **Stress**: Physical or emotional stress can trigger a cold sore outbreak.\n2. **Sun exposure**: UV rays can reactivate the virus.\n3. **Fatigue**: Lack of sleep or exhaustion can weaken your immune system, making you more susceptible to an outbreak.\n4. **Hormonal changes**: Hormonal fluctuations, such as those experienced during menstruation or pregnancy, can trigger a cold sore.\n5. **Weakened immune system**: If your immune system is compromised, you may be more prone to cold sore outbreaks.\n\nTo manage cold sores, you can try the following:\n\n1. **Antiviral medications**: Over-the-counter creams or prescription medications like acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir can help reduce the severity and duration of an outbreak.\n2. **Cold sore creams**: Topical creams containing docosanol or benzalkonium chloride can help soothe and heal cold sores.\n3. **Lifestyle changes**: Practice good hygiene, avoid sharing personal items, and manage stress to reduce the frequency of outbreaks.\n4. **Sun protection**: Use lip balm with SPF to protect your lips from the sun.\n\nIf you're experiencing frequent or severe cold sore outbreaks, consult with your healthcare provider for further guidance and treatment options.", "metadata": {"token_usage": {"completion_tokens": 551, "prompt_tokens": 30, "total_tokens": 581, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "model_name": "meta-llama/Llama-3-70b-chat-hf", "system_fingerprint": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "logprobs": null}, "prompt": "What is the cause of the cold sores on my mouth?

This test checks for the presence of high-risk HPV types that can cause cervical cancer.\n\n**Who should get screened:**\n\n* All women between 21 and 65 years old should get regular Pap tests.\n* Women between 25 and 65 years old can get an HPV test along with their Pap test.\n\n**Treatment:**\n\nIf your screening results show abnormal cell changes or the presence of high-risk HPV, your healthcare provider may recommend further testing or treatment. This may include:\n\n1. **Colposcopy**: A procedure to examine your cervix more closely using a special microscope.\n2. **Biopsy**: A procedure to remove a small sample of tissue from your cervix to check for cancer cells.\n3. **Treatment of abnormal cell changes**: If abnormal cell changes are found, your healthcare provider may recommend treatment to remove the abnormal cells. This can include:\n\t* **Cryotherapy**: Freezing the abnormal cells.\n\t* **LEEP (Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedure)**: Using a wire loop to remove the abnormal cells.\n\t* **Conization**: Removing a cone-shaped piece of tissue from the cervix.\n\n**Prevention:**\n\n1. **Get vaccinated**: If you're 25 or younger, you can still get vaccinated against HPV. The HPV vaccine is recommended for all individuals up to age 26.\n2. **Practice safe sex**: Using condoms and dental dams can help reduce the risk of HPV transmission.\n3. **Get regular screenings**: Regular Pap tests and HPV tests can help detect any abnormal cell changes or HPV infections early on.\n\n**Where to get screened and treated:**\n\nYou can get screened and treated for HPV at:\n\n1. Your primary care physician's office\n2. A gynecologist's office\n3. A community health clinic\n4. A Planned Parenthood health center\n\n**Cost and insurance:**\n\nMost insurance plans, including Medicaid and Medicare, cover Pap tests and HPV tests. Check with your insurance provider to confirm coverage.\n\nRemember, getting screened and treated for HPV is an important part of maintaining your reproductive health.

However, the extent of coverage and the specific services covered can differ significantly between plans.\n2. **Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act (MHPAEA)**: This federal law requires most health insurance plans to provide equal coverage for mental health and substance use disorders, including sex therapy, as they do for medical/surgical benefits. However, the law doesn't guarantee coverage for all sex therapy services.\n3. **Out-of-Network vs. In-Network Providers**: If you have a private insurance plan, check if your provider is in-network or out-of-network. In-network providers usually have a contract with your insurance company, which can result in lower out-of-pocket costs. Out-of-network providers may not be covered or may require higher copays and deductibles.\n4. **Medicare and Medicaid**: Medicare, a federal program for people 65 and older, and Medicaid, a joint federal-state program for low-income individuals, may cover sex therapy services, but the coverage is often limited and varies by state.\n5. **State-Specific Laws**: Some states, like California, New York, and New Jersey, have laws that require insurance companies to cover sex therapy services. Check your state's laws and regulations to see if they mandate coverage.\n\nTo determine if your insurance covers sex therapy, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Check your insurance policy documents**: Review your policy documents or insurance card to see if sex therapy is listed as a covered service.\n2. **Contact your insurance provider**: Reach out to your insurance company's customer service department to ask about coverage for sex therapy. Be prepared to provide your policy number and ask about:\n\t* Coverage for sex therapy services\n\t* Any limitations or exclusions\n\t* Copays, deductibles, and coinsurance rates\n\t* In-network and out-of-network provider options\n3. **Verify your provider's insurance participation**: If you've already found a sex therapist, ask them about their insurance participation and whether they're in-network or out-of-network with your insurance provider.\n\nAs a 25-year-old, you may have a private insurance plan through your employer, a parent's plan, or an individual plan. Be sure to explore your options and ask questions to understand your coverage.\n\nRemember, even if your insurance doesn't cover sex therapy, many therapists offer sliding scale fees or package deals to make their services more affordable.

There are several reasons why this might be happening, and I'll outline some possible explanations and suggestions to help you overcome this hurdle.\n\n**Common reasons why women may not orgasm during penetrative sex:**\n\n1. **Lack of clitoral stimulation**: The clitoris is the primary source of female sexual pleasure, and it's often not directly stimulated during penetrative sex. The clitoris is located outside the vagina, so penetration alone might not be enough to trigger an orgasm.\n2. **Insufficient foreplay**: Rushing into penetrative sex without adequate foreplay can make it difficult to reach orgasm. Foreplay helps increase arousal, lubrication, and blood flow to the genitals, making orgasm more likely.\n3. **Inadequate lubrication**: Friction can be uncomfortable and make it harder to orgasm. Ensure you have enough lubrication, either naturally or with the help of lubricants.\n4. **Positioning**: Certain positions might not allow for optimal clitoral stimulation or may cause discomfort, making orgasm more challenging.\n5. **Anxiety or stress**: Performance anxiety, stress, or distractions can make it difficult to relax and focus on your pleasure.\n6. **Hormonal changes**: Hormonal fluctuations, such as those experienced during pregnancy, menstruation, or menopause, can affect libido and orgasmic response.\n7. **Past trauma or sexual dysfunction**: Traumatic experiences or underlying sexual dysfunction can impact your ability to orgasm.\n8. **Lack of communication**: Not communicating your needs and desires with your partner can lead to unfulfilling sexual experiences.\n9. **Physical factors**: Certain medical conditions, such as vaginal dryness, pain during sex, or pelvic floor dysfunction, can make orgasm more difficult.\n\n**What you can do:**\n\n1. **Communicate with your partner**: Discuss your needs, desires, and any discomfort or pain with your partner. This can help you both find a more pleasurable and orgasmic experience.\n2. **Experiment with different positions**: Try positions that allow for more clitoral stimulation, such as the \"coital alignment technique\" or \"woman on top.\"\n3. **Focus on foreplay**: Engage in extended foreplay to increase arousal and lubrication. This can include oral sex, manual stimulation, or other forms of pleasure.\n4. **Use lubricants**: Apply lubricants to reduce friction and increase pleasure.\n5. **Try clitoral stimulation during sex**: Use your fingers or a vibrator to stimulate your clitoris during penetrative sex.\n6. **Practice self-pleasure**: Masturbate to learn what feels good for you and to increase your chances of orgasm during sex.\n7. **Consider sex therapy**: If you're experiencing persistent difficulties, consider consulting a sex therapist or counselor to address any underlying issues.\n8. **Relax and focus on pleasure**: Try to relax and focus on your pleasure during sex.

The risk of infertility depends on the type and dose of chemotherapy, as well as the woman's age at the time of treatment.\n2. **Hormonal therapies:** Some hormonal therapies, such as tamoxifen, can cause temporary infertility. However, this effect is usually reversible once treatment is stopped.\n3. **Radiation:** Radiation therapy to the breast or chest area is unlikely to affect fertility, but radiation to the pelvis or ovaries can increase the risk of infertility.\n\n**Pregnancy:**\n\n1. **Pregnancy after breast cancer:** It's generally recommended to wait 2-5 years after completing breast cancer treatment before getting pregnant. This allows time for any potential cancer cells to be detected and treated, and reduces the risk of the cancer recurring during pregnancy.\n2. **Pregnancy and breast cancer recurrence:** Research suggests that pregnancy does not increase the risk of breast cancer recurrence.

However, only a qualified healthcare professional can provide a proper diagnosis and treatment plan.\n\nA dermoid cyst, also known as a mature teratoma, is a type of benign tumor that can occur in various parts of the body, including the ovaries, testes, and skin. It's a developmental anomaly that forms from embryonic cells and can contain different types of tissue, such as skin, hair, teeth, and other bodily tissues.\n\nDermoid cysts are relatively rare, and they can occur at any age, including in young adults like yourself. Here are some possible symptoms and characteristics of a dermoid cyst:\n\n**Ovarian dermoid cysts:**\n\n* Most common type of dermoid cyst, affecting the ovaries\n* Can cause pelvic pain, especially during menstruation or ovulation\n* May cause abnormal bleeding, irregular periods, or infertility\n* Can be asymptomatic, discovered incidentally during a routine pelvic exam or imaging test\n\n**Skin dermoid cysts:**\n\n* Typically occur on the face, neck, or scalp\n* Appear as a small, firm, painless lump or bump\n* May be skin-colored or have a bluish tint\n* Can be tender to the touch or cause discomfort\n\n**Other symptoms:**\n\n* Abdominal pain or discomfort\n* Nausea and vomiting\n* Bloating or swelling\n* Weight gain or loss\n\nIf you're experiencing any of these symptoms, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for a proper evaluation. They will perform a physical exam, take a medical history, and may order imaging tests (e.g., ultrasound, CT, or MRI) to determine the presence and characteristics of a dermoid cyst.\n\nKeep in mind that many other conditions can cause similar symptoms, so a thorough diagnosis is necessary to rule out other possibilities.\n\nIf you do have a dermoid cyst, treatment options may include:\n\n1. Watchful waiting: Monitoring the cyst's growth and symptoms.\n2. Surgery: Removing the cyst, which may be necessary if it's causing symptoms, growing rapidly, or suspected to be cancerous (although this is rare).\n\nRemember, only a qualified healthcare professional can provide a definitive diagnosis and recommend appropriate treatment. If you're concerned about your symptoms or have questions, schedule an appointment with your primary care physician or a specialist (e.g., obstetrician-gynecologist or dermatologist).", "metadata": {"token_usage": {"completion_tokens": 515, "prompt_tokens": 25, "total_tokens": 540, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "model_name": "meta-llama/Llama-3-70b-chat-hf", "system_fingerprint": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "logprobs": null}, "prompt": "Do I have a dermoid cyst?

DES is a synthetic estrogen that was prescribed to pregnant women from the 1940s to the 1970s to prevent miscarriage and promote fetal growth. However, it was later found to have serious health risks for the children exposed to it in the womb.\n\nAs a DES-exposed individual, you may be at risk for certain health problems. The good news is that many DES-exposed individuals do not experience any adverse health effects. However, it's essential to be aware of the potential risks and take proactive steps to monitor your health.\n\nPossible health risks for DES-exposed individuals:\n\n1. **Reproductive issues:** Women exposed to DES in the womb may experience reproductive problems, such as:\n\t* Infertility or difficulty getting pregnant\n\t* Miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy\n\t* Premature birth or low birth weight\n\t* Abnormalities in the reproductive tract, such as a T-shaped uterus\n2. **Cancer risk:** DES exposure has been linked to an increased risk of:\n\t* Clear cell adenocarcinoma (a rare type of vaginal cancer)\n\t* Breast cancer (although the evidence is still limited)\n3. **Other health issues:** DES exposure may also be associated with:\n\t* Epithelial abnormalities in the cervix or vagina\n\t* Autoimmune disorders, such as lupus or thyroid disease\n\t* Psychological and emotional difficulties\n\nWhat you can do:\n\n1. **Inform your healthcare provider:** Share your DES exposure history with your healthcare provider, obstetrician, or gynecologist. They can help you monitor your health and provide guidance on any necessary screenings or tests.\n2. **Regular check-ups:** Attend regular health check-ups, including pelvic exams and Pap tests, to monitor your reproductive health.\n3. **Breast cancer screening:** Discuss breast cancer screening options with your healthcare provider, as you may need to start screening earlier than average-risk women.\n4. **Reproductive health:** If you're planning to become pregnant, consult with your healthcare provider about any potential risks or complications.\n5. **Join a DES support group:** Connecting with others who have been exposed to DES can provide emotional support and help you stay informed about the latest research and health recommendations.\n\nAt 25, you're taking a proactive step by educating yourself about your DES exposure. While it's essential to be aware of the potential risks, it's also important to remember that many DES-exposed individuals lead healthy lives without experiencing any adverse health effects.\n\nStay informed, and don't hesitate to reach out to your healthcare provider or a DES support group if you have any questions or concerns.", "metadata": {"token_usage": {"completion_tokens": 555, "prompt_tokens": 36, "total_tokens": 591, "completion_tokens_details": null, "prompt_tokens_details": null}, "model_name": "meta-llama/Llama-3-70b-chat-hf", "system_fingerprint": null, "finish_reason": "stop", "logprobs": null}, "prompt": "My mom took Diethylstilbestrol while pregnant with me.

Prostatitis is a condition that affects the prostate gland, which is a part of the male reproductive system. It's characterized by inflammation of the prostate gland, which can cause a range of symptoms including pelvic pain, urinary problems, and sexual dysfunction.\n\nProstatitis is not uncommon, but its prevalence varies depending on the type and age group. There are four main types of prostatitis:\n\n1. **Acute Bacterial Prostatitis (ABP)**: This is a sudden and severe infection of the prostate gland, usually caused by bacteria. It's relatively rare, accounting for about 5-10% of all prostatitis cases.\n2. **Chronic Bacterial Prostatitis (CBP)**: This is a long-term infection of the prostate gland, also caused by bacteria. It's more common than ABP, affecting about 10-15% of men at some point in their lives.\n3. **Chronic Prostatitis/Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome (CP/CPPS)**: This is the most common type of prostatitis, accounting for about 90% of all cases. It's characterized by chronic pelvic pain and urinary symptoms, but no bacterial infection is present. The exact cause is often unknown.\n4. **Asymptomatic Inflammatory Prostatitis (AIP)**: This type is characterized by inflammation of the prostate gland, but no symptoms are present. It's often diagnosed incidentally during a prostate biopsy or other medical procedures.\n\nRegarding your age, 25 is relatively young to develop prostatitis. However, it's not unheard of. According to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), prostatitis can affect men of all ages, including young men.\n\nIf you're experiencing symptoms that concern you, it's essential to consult a healthcare provider for a proper evaluation and diagnosis. They will perform a physical exam, take a medical history, and may order diagnostic tests such as a urinalysis, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test, or imaging studies to determine the cause of your symptoms.\n\nIn the meantime, here are some general symptoms to look out for:\n\n* Pelvic pain or discomfort\n* Painful urination\n* Frequent urination\n* Urgency to urinate\n* Blood in the urine or semen\n* Painful ejaculation\n* Fever and chills (in cases of bacterial prostatitis)\n\nRemember, only a qualified healthcare provider can diagnose prostatitis and develop an appropriate treatment plan.
