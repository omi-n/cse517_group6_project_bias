Use different techniques: Experiment with different techniques such as massage, kissing, oral sex, and using sex toys to enhance pleasure and arousal.\n\n4. Focus on erogenous zones: Pay attention to your partner's erogenous zones, such as the neck, ears, nipples, and inner thighs, as these areas are often sensitive and can help increase arousal.\n\n5. Be present and attentive: Show your partner that you are fully present and engaged by being attentive to their responses and cues. Check in with them regularly to make sure they are comfortable and enjoying themselves.\n\n6. Mix it up: Don't be afraid to mix things up and try new things during foreplay.
