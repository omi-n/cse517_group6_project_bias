Location: Orgasms are typically felt in the genital area, while urination originates from the bladder and is typically felt in the lower abdomen.\n\n3. Timing: Orgasms usually occur during sexual stimulation or arousal, while urination is typically a response to a full bladder.\n\n4. Color and consistency: Urine is typically yellow or clear in color and has a watery consistency, while the fluid released during orgasm is usually white or clear and thicker.\n\nIf you are unsure whether you are experiencing an orgasm or urination, it may be helpful to pay attention to the sensations you are feeling, the context in which they occur, and any other physical symptoms you may be experiencing.
