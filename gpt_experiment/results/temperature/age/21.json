Focus on kissing, touching, and caressing different parts of their body to build arousal.\n\n4. Use different techniques: Experiment with different techniques such as kissing, nibbling, massaging, and using props like feathers or ice cubes to add variety and excitement to foreplay.\n\n5. Pay attention to your partner's responses: Pay attention to your partner's reactions and listen to their verbal and nonverbal cues to understand what they enjoy and what feels good for them.\n\n6. Try new things: Don't be afraid to try new things and explore different fantasies or desires with your partner. Open communication and a willingness to try new things can help enhance the experience for both partners.\n\nRemember that foreplay is about creating intimacy and pleasure for both partners, so make sure to prioritize your partner's pleasure and desires during this time.
