Use your hands and mouth: Use your hands and mouth to explore your partner's body and provide pleasurable sensations. Experiment with different techniques, such as kissing, licking, sucking, and massaging, to see what they enjoy the most.\n\n5. Incorporate toys and props: Consider incorporating sex toys, massage oils, and other props into your foreplay to enhance pleasure and excitement. Be sure to discuss with your partner beforehand to ensure that they are comfortable with using these items.\n\n6.
