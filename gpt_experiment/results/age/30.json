Try different techniques: Experiment with different techniques and activities during foreplay, such as kissing, massaging, using sex toys, or engaging in role play. This can help keep things exciting and pleasurable for both partners.\n\n4.

Focus on these areas, such as the neck, ears, nipples, and inner thighs, to help build arousal and pleasure.\n\n5. Pay attention to your partner's responses: Pay attention to your partner's verbal and nonverbal cues during foreplay to gauge their level of arousal and pleasure.
