Orgasm is a pleasurable and intense physical and emotional experience that typically occurs during sexual activity or masturbation.\n2. During orgasm, there is a release of built-up sexual tension and muscle contractions in the pelvic area.\n3. Orgasm is often accompanied by a feeling of euphoria, relaxation, and satisfaction.\n4. Orgasm is typically associated with sexual arousal and stimulation.\n\nUrination:\n1. Urination is the process of expelling urine from the bladder through the urethra.\n2. Urination is a normal bodily function that helps eliminate waste and excess fluids from the body.\n3. Urination is typically not associated with pleasurable sensations or emotions.\n4. The urge to urinate is often felt as pressure in the lower abdomen or bladder.\n\nIf you are unsure whether you are experiencing orgasm or urination, it may be helpful to pay attention to the sensations and context in which they occur.
